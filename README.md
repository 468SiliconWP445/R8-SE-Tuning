In a nutshell:

This is a program written in Java (you will notice that it is not written very well) that basically simulates the upgrading of the Audi R8 e-tron Special Edition in Asphalt 8 prior to v4.1.

Use of any trademarked names does not imply any endorsement from the trademark holder. 

The calculations are with a tuning kit applied as hardly anybody used the car without a tuning kit.
